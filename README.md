## Notes

* Had a busy week and needed to use an extension for this one
* Incorporating and making some of the images to make the UI seem similar to the Fallout games was a little time consuming
* Implementing responsiveness was also a little challenging this time
* Not a challenge I encountered, but to clarify, I don't own Fallout, this is just a fan website
